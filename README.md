# Code Snippets

Personal playground for programming experiments with readable, production-ready code snippets.

Each demo is written to be copy-pasted into real projects - clean code, proper error handling, and follows established conventions.

## Categories

- **c/** - Basic C patterns (structs, unions, stdio)
- **linux-c/** - Linux system programming (sockets, semaphores, sysfs, pthread)
- **kernel-module/** - Linux kernel modules and KUnit tests
- **shell/** - Bash scripts (logging, option parsing)
- **python/** - Python demos (exception handling, introspection)
- **assembly/** - ARM64 assembly examples
- **concurrency/** - Concurrency algorithms (Dekker's algorithm, etc.)

## Goals

1. Readable, well-structured code
2. Follows language conventions (Linux kernel style for C, PEP 8 for Python)
3. Production-ready error handling
4. Easy to copy-paste and integrate

## To Be Reviewed

With the advent of llm, I will try to learn by review AI-generated code.
